            “Autumn Sonnet”<br>
by May Sarton<br>
<br><br>
If I can let you go as trees let go<br>
Their leaves, so casually, one by one;<br>
If I can come to know what they do know,<br>
That fall is the release, the consummation,<br>
Then fear of time and the uncertain fruit<br>
Would not distemper the great lucid skies<br>
This strangest autumn, mellow and acute.<br>
If I can take the dark with open eyes<br>
And call it seasonal, not harsh or strange<br>
(for love itself may need a time of sleep)<br>
And, treelike, stand unmoved before the change,<br>
Lose what I lose to keep what I can keep,<br>
The strong root still alive under the snow,<br>
Love will endure – if I can let you go.<br>
        </p>
