            Clearly whatever has erupted in me was not your design, you were only the catalyst, the pressurizing thing spilling me out and over the cup of my self. I take responsibility for the spill, but I’ll need help cleaning up. Wait — whose blood is whose?

            <em>Draining</em> … the lush sensuousness of “draining” falls short after the climax when it leads to the inevitability of “empty.” i’ve loved you like absolute hell and right now — bathed in Florida sun surrounded by blue birds i do not know the name of — I cannot imagine stopping loving you.

            but for the sake of both of us I have to.

            the story of a sculpture of Buddha made of pure gold, which was covered by citizens in clay to protect it from an incoming army seizing their city. I know that you’re working from your clay sheath when you say hurtful things to me, but I can’t keep getting caught in the crosshairs of your self-judgement.

            In therapy, I was thinking about how if you were a man I might have noticed some of the unfairness earlier. If a man I was dating critiqued my gender, drinking, eating, and body without any prior check-ins, I think I would have seen the communication differences sooner. I couldn’t recognize it because of some sort of grace surrounded around womanhood or maybe it’s just part of our dynamic. Maybe both?

            I don’t want to make some narrative that anyone here is all bad or all good. I regret so much the way I acted on graduation night and what I said to you. And regret the ways my drinking has negatively affected you and me — us. Times when I haven’t listened to you after you insisted on loving my manhood for what it is. Moments where I've been so enraptured in the narratives of my perceived inadequacies I distanced myself from you, left you alone. These are my only regrets. Still, it just seems like we keep hurting each other on accident. My therapist asked me how much more I can take… said she’s worried about the loss of self/confidence this relationship is putting me through.

            A friend asks me if I feel like I’d be betraying myself if went back to you and I feel like the answer is not betrayal but some sort of abandoning. Running from the kid in me to try and care for yours.

            I don’t think that right now I can say I forgive you because I’m still going through so much of the other feelings before forgiveness. Rage, sadness, shame, grief, fear. But I know I have the intention to forgive. And want to get there. I intend to forgive you — I have had such a pleasure of getting close to you these past few months and I know all of your sweetness, your grace, your smarts, your generosity, your absolute lightness of being. Forgiveness is not condoning. I have the privilege to advocate for my needs and boundaries, so I will. Im trying to now, here in the screen we always find ourselves in.

            I hope its clear that this is not all about that night — it’s about how much work we’re putting in to something that’s really hurting us. To be frank, I feel less of myself than I did when we first met. And maybe that is the beautiful transformation that can be experienced from loving. And much of it is the pressurizing of grad school. But some of it is a weakening, a splintered creak, a calloused index — emerging from our connection. I feel so grateful that you showed me all the parts of me I need to work on but I can’t keep getting pierced in these sore torrid spots while I’m working on repairing them.

            But … this isn’t <em>not</em> about sex as well, is it? In learning more about my relationship to sex it feels important for me to be with someone safe. Someone who can help me embody intimacy during sex rather than perform it. I understand the ways in which that mode is necessary for you and it's been necessary for me as well. But with us, I like when it has space to be something else. Communicatively and consensually vacillating between the performative and the embodied. At times, you’re able to be in that place of embodied sexual connection with me. We have had such beautiful exchanges, moments of true connection, my god — how sexy, how disarmingly unified, how cyclically orange. I loved it.

            Yet, other times the hue goes suddenly cold. Most recently, on FaceTime. Other times through snide little cruelties during or after sex. Where our so-called “spiritual sex” gets relegated and reduced with the dullness and quickness of a Grindr notification. Filling in my silent gaps with patriarchal pre-conceived notions of fucking. <em>swipe, swipe, swipe,</em>

            The inconsistency, the criticisms, and the lack of careful communication is what hurts. Hurts me in the exact places I do not want to be hurt, places I asked you to touch with caution, that I showed you in the intimate light of our love. And I understand you were expressing a need — I love that you feel comfortable enough to express that to me, I really do. I just wish it was approached in the appropriate context and said in a way that I could receive it better. The approach felt like a reckless betrayal.

            In the curved moonlight of the evening I ask: can we make it? or is it just going to be the same shit? just us spiraling in circles over and over again in my bedroom? excavating trauma and quoting theory at each other until our brains melt to nothing and we fuck into some abyss? can i be so exposed again? sometimes it feels we're having one long hard conversation with orgasms in-between. something needs to change.

            While it is so much easier to reach for the tenacity of blame, I'd rather reach for the less sharp tools: understanding and love and grace. Assigning blame is not as helpful as recognizing pain. Recognizing pain is not as helpful as reducing it when you can.

            Suzy, I've never felt a connection like this with anyone I've ever been with romantically and I want to honor the beauty and intimacy of our togethering the best way I know how and I think that's by being as honest as we have been so far.  It pains me to think that even between two folks who share so much love and care for each other things can still not work out. It pains me to see our fantasy, our two bedroom apartment, fall to pieces. We have both tried so hard at this and I think that speaks to how much care we have for each other and how capable we each are of loving. But I don't think this is working as it stands right now and that we need to re-adjust. I think it's best we continue on as friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't know all of the details of what that looks like but I know it requires space and time. The same capaciousness I've found within you. I hope we can figure it out. I'll talk with you soon.
        </p>

            I love you,
            <br>B.
